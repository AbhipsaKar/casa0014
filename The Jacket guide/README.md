Overview of 'The Jacket guide' project.

Components used from Arduino IOT kit:
1. Arduino UNO board
2. Breadboard
3. Jumper cables
4. TMP sesnor
5. DHT(Humidity sensor)
6. DC Motor
7. Servo motor
8. Photo diodes
9. Capacitor
10. USB cable

Setup:
Connected as per the circuit diagram given below:

Creation of the physical product:
Created blades for the DC motor to act as the windmill(out of cardboard cutting).
Created an outer casing with a stand to prop the DC motor(out of cardboard box).
Created an flat surface to cover the Arduino board and circuitry as well as hide the servo motor(barring the pointer) to give it an appearance of a dial.

Pictures of the final product:

Things to think about in the next design iterations:

1. how to get the real world readings with a short usb cable?
2. wind mill design not working practically. How to optimise?
3. the wind sensor only allows current in one direction. Need to optimise and rethink.
4. too many leds complicating the circuit design. Need to simplify.
5. How to go about getting rid of spurious data?
6. how to create baselines for wind, humidity and temperature? 
7. which is better: personalisation or generalisation?
8. How to build an durable outer casing to survive the weather elements?
